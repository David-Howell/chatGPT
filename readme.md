# Titanic Survival Analysis
This project uses exploratory data analysis and machine learning to classify the passengers of the Titanic as survivors and those who perished. The data used in this project comes from the [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need to have the following installed on your system:

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* Plotly.express (optional)

### Installing
To install the required libraries, you can use `pip`:

```python
    pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn plotly.express<br>
```
Alternatively, you can install the libraries using conda:

```python
conda install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn plotly.express<br>
```
## Running the Code
To run the code, you can use the following command:

```python 
python titanic_classification.py
```
This will run the `titanic_classification.py` script, which performs exploratory data analysis on the data and trains a machine learning model to classify the passengers as survivors and those who perished.

## Results

The results of the analysis and modeling are shown in the following sections.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
The first step in this project was to perform exploratory data analysis on the data to gain insights and identify patterns. This was done using a combination of summary statistics and visualizations.

For example, the following code calculates summary statistics for the data:

```python
data.describe()
```

The output of this code shows the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for each variable in the data.

Additionally, the following code creates a bar plot showing the number of survivors and those who perished by sex:

```python
data.groupby(['Sex', 'Survived']).size().plot(kind='bar')
```

The output of this code is a bar plot that shows that there were more male passengers who died than female passengers who died, but there were also more male passengers who survived than female passengers who survived.

### Machine Learning

After performing exploratory data analysis on the data, the next step was to use a machine learning algorithm to train a model on the data. The goal of the model was to learn the relationship between the different variables in the data and the outcome (whether a passenger survived or not).

In this project, a logistic regression model was used to classify the passengers as survivors and those who perished. The model was trained on a training set and then evaluated on a test set to assess its performance.

The following code trains a logistic regression model on the data:

```python
# Prepare the data for modeling
X = data[['Age', 'Sex', 'Pclass']]
y = data['Survived']

# Split the data into a training set and a test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train a logistic regession model
model = LogisticReg
```
